SnowballTarget is an environment we created at Hugging Face using assets from [Kay Lousberg](https://www.kaylousberg.com/) **where you train an agent called Julien the bear 🐻 that learns to hit targets with snowballs**.

You can learn **to train this agent using Deep Reinforcement Learning** 👉 [with this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit5/introduction).
